# Ansible Variable

- Ansible uses variables to manage differences between systems. 
- With Ansible, you can execute tasks and playbooks on multiple different systems with a single command. 
- To represent the variations among those different systems, you can create variables with standard YAML syntax, including lists and dictionaries. 
- You can define these variables in your playbooks, in your inventory, in re-usable files or roles, or at the command line.
-  You can also create variables during a playbook run by registering the return value or values of a task as a new variable.
